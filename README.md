# Dante bot

## About
This bot was created to increase the satisfaction of playing Skyblock on [Hypixel Network](https://hypixel.net/), now you can easily compare your stats with your guild mates and possibly make fun of them (or the other way around). For guild leaders it is a great tool to monitor the progress or activity of players, a deeper analysis (soon) will allow you to manage the guild more effectively (probably, just don't be too harsh on them please).

## Discord invite
Soon

## Features
